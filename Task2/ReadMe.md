What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has become the de facto standard for version control in the software development industry.\

My Finding in Git:
Version Control System (VCS): It helps developers manage and track changes to their codebase over time.

Distributed System: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed. Each developer will have a complete copy of the repository on their local machine.

Branch: Git allows developers to work on different branches, which are separate lines of development.

Pull Request (PR): In Git-based collaboration workflows, a pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository.

Remote: A remote is a version of a repository that is hosted on a server, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.

Merge: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is typically done to incorporate new features or bug fixes into the main branch.

How To Install Git?

git branch <branch_name>//Create a new branch
git merge <source_branch>//Merge branches
git pull//pull a request
git push//push changes

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. It provides a place for developers to host and share their code repositories, 
collaborate on projects, track issues, and manage software development projects. GitHub is widely used in the software development community, serving as a 
central hub for version control and project management.
